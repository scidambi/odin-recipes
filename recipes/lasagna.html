        <li> 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano </li>
        <li> 1/8 teaspoon white sugar </li>
        <li> 1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles </li>
        <li> 1 pound small-curd cottage cheese </li>
        <li> 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese </li>
        <li> 3 large eggs </li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons salt </li>
        <li> 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
        <li> 1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese </li>


    </ul>

     <H2> Directions</H2>

     <ol>
        <li> <strong> Step 1 - </strong> Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li> <strong> Step 2 - </strong> Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. </li>
        <li> <strong> Step 3 - </strong> Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li> <strong> Step 4 - </strong> Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. </li>
        <li> <strong> Step 5 - </strong> While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
        <li> <strong> Step 6 - </strong> Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined. </li>
        <li> <strong> Step 7 - </strong> Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. </li>
        <li> <strong> Step 8 - </strong> Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. </li>
        <li> <strong> Step 9 - </strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes. </li>
        <li> <strong> Step 10 - </strong> Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving. </li>

     </ol>
